# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a Fedora system setup repository containing configuration scripts and documentation for turning a fresh Fedora install into a usable development system. The repository is currently minimal, containing only a README.md file that outlines the planned setup.

## Purpose

The repository serves as a collection of scripts and configurations to install and configure:
- Development tools (Neovim, lazygit, Docker, tmux, fish shell, oh my fish, Git, Bun, nvm)
- Hyprland desktop environment with Wayland
- Custom configurations for a complete development environment

## Current State

The repository is in its initial planning phase with only documentation present. The actual installation scripts and configuration files are not yet implemented.

## Development Workflow

Since this is a system setup repository:
- Scripts should be created as needed for different installation phases
- Configuration files should be organized by application/tool
- Test any scripts in a virtual machine or isolated environment before use
- Document any dependencies or prerequisites for each script

## External Dependencies

The repository references the Hyprland installation script from: https://github.com/JaKooLit/Fedora-Hyprland

## Git Information
